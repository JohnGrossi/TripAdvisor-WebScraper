# TripAdvisor-WebScraper
Project for a friend to help speed up a manual process. Web scraper that takes specific information from trip advisor on 2000 locations.
Using Selenium to manually go through site to get to specific pages and save them. Then use BeautifulSoup to take the information from the site

Not the most efficient code but was written with a very short deadline. Would like to come back to this to improve the code.
